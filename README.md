#Task 3: Conditional Statements & Logical Flow

📌 Project Description

This project is a Grade Calculator built using Python.
It demonstrates the use of conditional statements, logical operators, and nested conditions to implement real-world, decision-based business logic.

The program takes student marks as input and assigns grades along with performance remarks while handling invalid inputs gracefully.
